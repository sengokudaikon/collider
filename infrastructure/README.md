# Collider Infrastructure - K3S + Terraform + Helm

This directory contains the consolidated infrastructure configuration for Collider, using **Terraform** to manage **K3S clusters** with **Helm** for application deployment.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

**Unified K3S-based deployment** supporting two environments:
- **Local**: K3D cluster on your development machine
- **Production**: K3S single-node cluster on Google Cloud Platform

### Technology Stack
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code for cluster and cloud resources
- **K3S/K3D**: Lightweight Kubernetes for both local and production
- **Helm**: Application packaging and deployment
- **GCP**: Production hosting

### Core Services
All environments deploy the same service topology:
- **Application**: Rust-based Collider server
- **PostgreSQL 16**: Event data storage with optimized configuration
- **Dragonfly**: Redis-compatible cache for sub-millisecond responses
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and monitoring
- **Grafana**: Visualization dashboards with pre-configured datasources
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing for performance monitoring

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**Local Development:**
```bash
# Required tools
brew install terraform kubectl helm k3d docker
# or your package manager equivalent
```

**Production Deployment:**
```bash
# Additional for production
brew install google-cloud-sdk
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

### Local Development (Recommended)

```bash
# Deploy complete local environment
just dev-setup

# Or step by step:
just deploy-local     # Deploy to local K3D cluster
just verify-local     # Verify everything is working
just cluster-status   # Check status
```

**Access your services:**
- Application: http://localhost:30080
- Grafana: http://localhost:30300 (admin/check terraform output)
- Prometheus: http://localhost:30090
- Jaeger: http://localhost:30686

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to production
just deploy-prod your-gcp-project-id

# Verify deployment
just verify-prod

# Get access information
just prod-info
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
The system uses sensible defaults with environment-specific overrides:

**Local Environment:**
- Optimized for development machines (reduced resource limits)
- Uses `local-path` storage class
- Enables NodePort for direct access
- Uses localhost registry

**Production Environment:**
- Production-ready resource allocation
- Uses `standard-rwo` storage class
- Configures external access via GCP Compute
- Integrates with GCP services

### Terraform Variables
Key variables in `terraform/variables.tf`:

```hcl,ignore
# Core
environment       = "local" | "prod"
gcp_project_id   = "your-project"     # Required for prod

# K3S Configuration
kubeconfig_path  = "~/.kube/config"   # Prod only
k3s_context      = "default"          # Prod only

# GCP Configuration (Prod only)
gcp_region       = "europe-west4"     # Netherlands
gcp_instance_type = "e2-standard-2"   # 2 vCPU, 8GB RAM
disk_size        = 50                 # GB
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Details

### Local Environment (K3D)
- **K3D cluster**: `collider-local` with integrated registry
- **Local registry**: `localhost:5001` for image storage
- **Nginx Ingress**: Automatic HTTP routing
- **Local storage**: `local-path` provisioner
- **Direct access**: NodePort services on localhost

### Production Environment (GCP + K3S)
- **Compute Instance**: `e2-standard-2` with Ubuntu 22.04
- **K3S installation**: Single-node cluster with optimizations
- **Persistent disks**: SSD storage for data
- **Firewall rules**: Secure access to K3S API and NodePorts
- **External access**: Public IP with NodePort services

### Security Considerations
- **Firewall rules**: Restrict access to necessary ports only
- **Secret management**: Terraform-generated secrets
- **Network policies**: Isolated namespace communication
- **Resource limits**: Prevent resource exhaustion

## üîÑ Migration from Previous Setup

This infrastructure replaces the previous docker-compose and multi-environment Terraform setup with:

### Benefits
- **Unified approach**: Same technology stack for local and production
- **Simplified environments**: Only local and prod (no dev/staging complexity)
- **Better resource utilization**: Kubernetes scheduling and management
- **Production parity**: Identical service topology everywhere
- **Improved debugging**: Rich Kubernetes tooling and commands

### Migration Steps
1. **Backup data**: Export any important data from existing deployments
2. **Deploy new infrastructure**: `just dev-setup`
3. **Verify functionality**: `just verify-local`
4. **Update CI/CD**: Point to new deployment commands
5. **Clean up old resources**: Remove docker-compose and old Terraform
